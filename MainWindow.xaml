Key roles for a successful analytic project include a business user, project sponsor, project manager, business intelligence analyst, data engineer, database administrator and data scientist.  Machine learning and algorithms can hardly be separated. A machine learning model like regression or clustering or neural networks utilizes the workings of algorithms. There are many types of models in  R such as regression models, classification models and mixed models that are a combination of both.   Classification is a less frequently encountered part of the machine learning spectrum. Instead of predicting continuous values like numbers in classification exercises we will predict discrete values. An example of a classification algorithm is a logistic regression algorithm.  Regression takes in continuous numeric data and then outputs continuous numeric data. Classification which takes in continuous numeric data and outputs discrete data. There are many machine learning algorithms in R, some are focused on regression whereas others are focused entirely on classification and a third class can utilize both.   "/>

It is a good example of an ecosystem of algorithms that can be used both in a supervised and unsupervised case.   Tree based methods include a decision tree. The random forests is another version of a decision tree. A decision tree provides an output based on custom inputs  and by involving numerous decision trees instead of just one to generate an output based on a specific custom input , you build an ensemble classifier or a forest. The decision criteria is slightly different.   "/>
